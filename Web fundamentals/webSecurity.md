# Difference Between HTTP and HTTPS

HTTP and HTTPS are both protocols used for transferring data between a web browser and a web server. However, HTTPS is more secure than HTTP. Let’s walk through how both work and the key differences.

## 1. **What is HTTP?**

### Definition:
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used to send and receive web pages and data on the internet. It’s the foundation of how the web works.

### How It Works:
- **Request**: When you visit a website, your browser sends a request using HTTP to the server.
- **Response**: The server responds by sending back the website’s data.
- **No Security**: The data is sent in **plain text**, meaning anyone who intercepts the connection can read the data.

### When to Use:
- **HTTP** is fine for websites where you don't enter sensitive information (like personal details or passwords). Examples include blogs or informational pages.

## 2. **What is HTTPS?**

### Definition:
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an improved version of HTTP. It adds security by encrypting the data between your browser and the server using SSL/TLS.

### How It Works:
1. **Secure Request**: When you visit a website using HTTPS, your browser first checks the site’s security certificate.
2. **SSL/TLS Encryption**: Once the certificate is verified, SSL/TLS encryption is used to protect the data being exchanged.
3. **Secure Data**: All information exchanged, like passwords or credit card numbers, is encrypted so that even if someone intercepts the data, they cannot read it.

### When to Use:
- **HTTPS** should always be used when handling sensitive information, such as logging into an account, making a payment, or entering personal data.

## 3. **Key Differences Between HTTP and HTTPS**

| Feature                   | HTTP                              | HTTPS                             |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Security**               | No encryption, data is visible to anyone who intercepts it | Data is encrypted, making it secure from hackers |
| **Port**                   | Uses port 80                      | Uses port 443                     |
| **SSL/TLS Certificate**    | No certificate required           | Needs an SSL/TLS certificate to ensure security |
| **SEO Ranking**            | Lower ranking in search engines   | Higher ranking in search engines  |
| **Performance**            | Faster since there’s no encryption | Slightly slower due to encryption |
| **Indication in Browser**  | No padlock or warning             | A padlock icon appears, showing the site is secure |

## 4. **Why HTTPS is Better**

- **Encryption**: With HTTPS, all data is encrypted, so no one can read it even if they intercept the traffic.
- **Security**: HTTPS protects against **man-in-the-middle attacks**, where a hacker might try to intercept or alter your communication.
- **Trust**: When you see the padlock icon in the browser, it means the website is legitimate and your information is safe.

## 5. **How SSL and TLS Work**

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are protocols used to secure communication between a web browser and a server. TLS is the successor to SSL and is more secure.

### **How SSL/TLS Works**

1. **Establishing a Secure Connection**:
   - When you visit a website using HTTPS, the browser connects to the server and requests a secure connection.

2. **SSL/TLS Handshake**:
   - **Server Sends Certificate**: The server sends its SSL/TLS certificate, which contains its public key.
   - **Certificate Verification**: The browser checks the certificate to verify the server’s identity and ensures it was issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).
   
3. **Session Key Generation**:
   - **Key Exchange**: The browser and server agree on an encryption method and generate a session key to encrypt the communication.
   - The session key is used for **symmetric encryption**, meaning both the server and browser use the same key to encrypt and decrypt the data.

4. **Secure Communication**:
   - Once the session key is established, all data exchanged between the browser and the server is encrypted, ensuring confidentiality and preventing unauthorized access.

*Above: Diagram showing the SSL/TLS handshake and encryption process.*

### **Why SSL/TLS is Important**
- **Encryption**: Keeps data private by encrypting it during transmission.
- **Authentication**: Verifies the server's identity, ensuring the communication is with the correct website.
- **Data Integrity**: Protects the data from being altered while it’s transmitted.

## 6. **Conclusion**

- **HTTP** is suitable for non-sensitive websites, but it’s not secure for anything important.
- **HTTPS** should be used on any site that handles personal information like login credentials, credit card details, or private data.
- Most modern websites today use **HTTPS** to ensure privacy and security for their users.

**In Short**: Use HTTP for basic, non-sensitive browsing. For anything involving passwords, payments, or private data, always use HTTPS to keep your information safe.
